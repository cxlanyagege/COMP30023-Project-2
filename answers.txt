3.2 Planning task

1. For the scenario of this project service only, I believe that the server can 
   accept calls from everyone because all calls are limited and known. But from 
   a real-world perspective, considering the different operational requirements 
   and security verification of the server, only a small number of users may be 
   allowed to call it to ensure the security of server data.

2. Most general authentication should be directly placed in the RPC framework, 
   which can efficiently ensure that every connection is authenticated and 
   secure. For real-world scenarios, there may be some special validation 
   scenarios (such as secondary validation), and these individual validation 
   methods need to be placed in their functions.
